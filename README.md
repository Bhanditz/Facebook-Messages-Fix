# Facebook-Messages-Fix
Widens Facebook messages screen and gets rid of annoying "ego" column. Uses javascript to inject CSS into the page with the aid of a browser extension such as Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey.

This is deprecated by the 2017-01-16 change, but this should be adaptable for use with the news feed. I never look at any part of Facebook except facebook.com/messages, so I will not be putting any further work into this. Feel free to submit a pull request if you adapt this for more general use.
